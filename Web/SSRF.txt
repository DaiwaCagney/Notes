blacklist-based input filters:
Use an alternative IP representation of 127.0.0.1, such as 2130706433, 017700000001, or 127.1
Register your own domain name that resolves to 127.0.0.1. You can use spoofed.burpcollaborator.net for this purpose
Obfuscate blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation
Provide a URL that you control, which redirects to the target URL
Try using different redirect codes, as well as different protocols for the target URL. For example, switching from an http: to https

whitelist-based input filters:
You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the @ character
https://expected-host:fakepassword@evil-host
You can use the # character to indicate a URL fragment
https://evil-host#expected-host
You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control
https://expected-host.evil-host
You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code
You can also try double-encoding characters

Bypassing SSRF filters via open redirection:
/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=6&path=http://evil-user.net

Referer header is often a useful attack surface for SSRF vulnerabilities
