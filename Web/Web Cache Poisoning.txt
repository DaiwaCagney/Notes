Caches identify equivalent requests by comparing a predefined subset of the request's components, known collectively as the "cache key"
Typically, this would contain the request line and Host header
Components of the request that are not included in the cache key are said to be "unkeyed"
Any web cache poisoning attack relies on manipulation of unkeyed inputs, such as headers
As the poisoned cache is more a means of distribution than a standalone attack, the impact of web cache poisoning is inextricably linked to how harmful the injected payload is
The poisoned response will only be served to users who visit the affected page while the cache is poisoned
Whether or not a response gets cached can depend on all kinds of factors, such as the file extension, content type, route, status code, and response headers

Burp Param Miner extension --> automate the process of identifying unkeyed inputs

Example:
GET /en?region=uk HTTP/1.1
Host: innocent-website.com
X-Forwarded-Host: innocent-website.co.uk

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public
<meta property="og:image" content="https://innocent-website.co.uk/cms/social.png" />

Become:
GET /en?region=uk HTTP/1.1
Host: innocent-website.com
X-Forwarded-Host: a."><script>alert(1)</script>"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public
<meta property="og:image" content="https://a."><script>alert(1)</script>"/cms/social.png" />
