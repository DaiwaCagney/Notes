HTTP/1 specification provides two different ways to specify where a request ends: 
Content-Length header / Transfer-Encoding header

POST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

b
q=smuggling
0

Message body contains one or more chunks of data
Each chunk consists of the chunk size in bytes (expressed in hexadecimal), followed by a newline, followed by the chunk contents
The message is terminated with a chunk of size zero

if both the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers are present, then the Content-Length header should be ignored

Websites that use HTTP/2 end-to-end are inherently immune to request smuggling attacks
